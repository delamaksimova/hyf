    <h1 id="hello">Hello!</h1>
    <p id="welcome">I am <strong>Dela</strong>, a person who loves to discover and learn.<br><br>I was born and raised in Elista, a pretty little town of southern Russia.<br>Four years ago I moved to Lund where I studied Innovation Economics, learned Swedish and felt like it's my second home. That is why I decided to stay and start my career here.<br><br>With 2 degrees in Economics, work experiences in administration and a great interest in analysis I am on my way to fulfill my goal - work creatively with data.<br><br>Today I am learning programming with HackYourFuture and reading Aspirantutbildning at Malm√∂ University. I believe these are other essential keys in my wallet to crack <strong>my dream job</strong>!</p>
